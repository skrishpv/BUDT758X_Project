# Twitterrati and Climate Change
## Web Scraping and Data Analysis using python
Our project aims at understanding how different countries in the world are reacting to climate change on twitter and presenting an overview of what they think.
We scraped twitter data using tweepy API and also data from climate change related websites using Beautiful soup to create a pandas data frame which we used to perform our analysis.
